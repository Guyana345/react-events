## Available Scripts
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `hot reload`
- using hot module reload-webpackk: therefore you don't need to refresh the page to see updates:
works in most cases with no problems
- if you see any errors just hard reload the page should be fine

### `npm test`
------ Not yet implemented at this point ----

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## `supported-browsers`

## `deployment`
- this application will be deployed to Firebase
